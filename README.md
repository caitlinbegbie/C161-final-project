# Astro C161 Final Project: Evaluating the Flat Universe Model with Type 1a Supernovae
### By Caitlin Begbie and Emma Yu
In this project our objective was to determine the feasibility of assuming we live in a flat universe. We did this by considering Type IA supernovae data and galaxy data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) with their associated Hubble parameters. We determined a relation between redshift ($z$) and apparent magnitude ($m$) for a flat universe model, which read as follows:
$\Huge m-M = 5log_{10}[\frac{{\frac{c}{H_{0}}}(1+z)\int_{0}^{z}\frac{1}{E(z')} \,dz'}{1 Mpc}]+25$ 


We achieve this in the following steps:
